## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a mobile first single page application that lists books stored in a remote database.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
This application takes no setup, as the front end is hosted on gihub pages, and the backend is deployed on heroku. The user only needs to navigate to the url in their browser.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The application is built on express and node.js, and the serverside and database are deployed to heroku, with persistent data stored in a heroku postgresSQL database. The front end utilizes jquery for for DOM manipulation, and Page.js for routing to allow behavior of a single page application.

## Change Log
